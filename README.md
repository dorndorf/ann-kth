This repo was used for the course "[Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Architectures](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2437?l=en)" during the spring term 2020 at KTH Royal Institute for Technology Stockholm.

There were four assignments about:
- Learning and generalisation in feed-forward networks | from perceptron learning to backprop  
- Radial basis function (RBF) networks, competitive learning (CL) and self-organising maps (SOMs)
- Hopfield networks
- Deep belief nets
